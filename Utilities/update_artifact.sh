# Note: The LLBArtifact struct was manually edited to be a class instead of a struct. This was made on purpose
# to allow for a nice API when using Artifacts to construct action graphs, since it means that users can use a single
# reference to the LLBArtifact object that can get updated dynamically to reference the artifact owner that generates it
# after the Artifact was created and moved around. I agree that this is a signal that SwiftProtobuf might be a bad fit
# for this problem, but the benefits that we get around serialization and interface definition through proto files
# outweighs this cost and we're ok with having this technical debt in the time being. If we ever move to a nicer
# serialization mechanism, we can remove this restriction (Artifact just needs to be a class for the API to be nice).
