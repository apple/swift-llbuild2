// The reference to a rule evaluation key. This is used for 2 purposes: to avoid having a large rule evaluation key
// since the configured target might be large in size (potentially avoidable with proper CAS architecture) and to use
// as a reference for artifact ownership. Artifacts then get a reference to the rule evaluation that registered them in
// order to find the action that generates it. Initially this was solved by uploading the action itself into the CAS and
// having the artifact ownership point to that, but there was a cycle issue when uploading the action keys as some input
// artifacts had not been updated yet. With this approach, artifacts get the ownership during action registration,
// avoiding that particular issue.

// This is different from EvaluatedTargetKey in that it is a scoped down version of evaluation, since it does not
// require the presence of the rootID field, which effectively changes with any change in the workspace. The digest of
// a RuleEvaluationKey should be stable to the _contents_ of a configured target. This means that if a source file
