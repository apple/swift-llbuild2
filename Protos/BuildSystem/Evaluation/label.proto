/// A Label represents a handle for finding a target within a workspace. It is made up of 2 components: the logical path
/// to the target's container (i.e. a package or project, depends on the context) and the name of the target within that
/// container. Build systems can choose to interpret the components of a label as needed, but they must all resolve into
/// a unique target. Labels have a String representation in the form of `//logical/container/path:target_name`, but it
/// is up to each build system how they choose how to construct Labels and whether they should be presented to the end
/// users. Labels are used in llbuild2 as a differentiator between targets, to aide in the deduplication of processing
/// targets and as a cross-build system coordination system, for example, if llbuild2 build systems chose to integrate
/// other build systems into the mix.
